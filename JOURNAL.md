This is my journal of the design and building process of **Allwinner V3s SBC**.

## 10/3/2025 - Initial Planning & Schematics  

Did a lot of initial planning and research today about the Allwinner V3S. I researched about a lot of SoCs but the V3s was my top choice due it having embedded DRAM and its availability on JLCPCB.

My plan with this project is to make my own SBC in a Raspberry Pi Zero form factor to learn about embedded linux. 

In addition to reading the V3s datasheet I also worked on researching ICs for my video output (the V3s does not have a HDMI PHY so I'll need a RGB to HDMI bridge), and an IC for wifi.

I also started working on its schematics today. So far I've only labeled and setup my power rails for the V3s
